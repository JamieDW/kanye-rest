# kanye-rest
 A laravel wrapper for the Kayne rest API

## TODO

The challenge will contain a few core features most applications have. That includes connecting to an API, basic MVC using Laravel, exposing an API, and finally, tests.

- [ ] The API we want you to connect to is https://kanye.rest/

- [ ] The application should have the following features

- [ ] A rest API that shows 5 random Kayne West quotes (must)

- [ ] There should be an endpoint to refresh the quotes and fetch the next 5 random quotes (must)

- [ ] Authentication for these APIs should be done with an API token, not using any package. (must)

- [ ] The above features are tested with Feature tests (must)

- [ ] The above features are tested with Unit tests (nice to have)

- [ ] Provide a README on how we can set up and test the application (must)

- [ ] Implementation of API using Laravel Manager Design Pattern (Plus)

- [ ] Making third-party API response quick by cache(Plus)
